This template dashboard is comprised of the following pages:

server.R
ui.R
text.R
theme.R

server.R ----------------- 
Contains the majority of code that compiles the dashboard, managing the theme and passing UI elements that are dependent on user interaction. 

Running server.R via "Run App" in RStudio will run the dashboard locally. Equally running from ui.R will do the same.
